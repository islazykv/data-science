# Data Science Physics
<div style="text-align: right">
During my Ph.D. studies I had a chance to work on the Ring-Imaging Chrenkov (RICH) detector upgrade for the LHCb experiment at CERN. The analysis scripts used for my Ph.D. thesis were written in the Python/C++ using CERN ROOT library for the data visualization. I decided to take some part of the analysis, rewrite it to be 100% python code using the most common data visualization libraries such as: Matplotlib and Seaborn, make it Jupyter-Notebook friendly and upload it here.
